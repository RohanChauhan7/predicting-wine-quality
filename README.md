# predicting-wine-quality
This project explores the winequality-red dataset using various regression models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The goal is to evaluate and compare their performance using RÂ² scores to determine which model best predicts wine quality based on its physicochemical features.
